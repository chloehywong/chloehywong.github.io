# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I’m a Digital Marketing student from Hong Kong with an interest in UX and Web design.

In the past, I have worked with HK Charities and local startup firms with high-paced environments. I enjoy my work as much as the great relationships I’ve built with clients and colleagues because of my belief in working hard, working together and having fun along the way. Meanwhile, I love learning as I have been doing self-learning in programming and web/UX design during my studies. If you’re interested in learning more about me or my work, simply reach out.
